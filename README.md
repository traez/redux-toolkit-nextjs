- Typescript  
- Nodejs (with/without Expressjs)
- MongoDB**  
- GraphQL**    
- Redux Toolkit 

### What I learned
 
- From what I've observed, the main difference between using **Redux Toolkit in Next.js** vs **Vanilla React** is how the store provider is wrapped around the children component. In Next.js, the configuration isn't done directly in the layout component because it's server-side rendered. Instead, it's done elsewhere and then imported into the layout. The official docs also strongly advises using Redux Toolkit strategically for globally shared, mutable data that needs centralized management. For other types of state, it's recommended to leverage the built-in features of Next.js and React to keep your application efficient and maintainable.
- Practical use of **"react-hot-toast"**. It serves as a visual notification for users to confirm actions.   
- Practical use of **"react-icons"**. This project was a refresher for me on incorporating react-icons into applications.  
- Practical use of **"framer-motion"**. It is used for implementing animations.
